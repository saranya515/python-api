S3
==

By following this guide, you will learn how to use features of S3 client that
are unique to the SDK, specifically the generation and use of pre-signed URLs,
pre-signed POSTs, and the use of the transfer manager. You will also learn how
to use a few common, but important, settings specific to S3.


Changing the Addressing Style
-----------------------------

S3 supports two different ways to address a bucket, Virtual Host Style and Path
Style. This guide won't cover all the details of `virtual host addressing`_, but
you can read up on that in S3's docs. In general, the SDK will handle the
decision of what style to use for you, but there are some cases where you may
want to set it yourself. For instance, if you have a CORS configured bucket
that is only a few hours old, you may need to use path style addressing for
generating pre-signed POSTs and URLs until the necessary DNS changes have time
to propagagte.

Note: if you set the addressing style to path style, you HAVE to set the correct
region.

The preferred way to set the addressing style is to use the ``addressing_style``
config parameter when you create your client or resource.::

    import boto3
    from botocore.client import Config

    # Other valid options here are 'auto' (default) and 'virtual'
    s3 = boto3.client('s3', 'us-west-2', config=Config(s3={'addressing_style': 'path'}))


Using the Transfer Manager
--------------------------

The `s3 transfer manager`_ provides you with less painful multipart uploads and
downloads. Its functions are automatically added into the client when you create
it, so there is no need to create your own transfer manager. Below you will see
several examples of how to use it.

The methods on the base client are :py:meth:`S3.Client.upload_file` and
:py:meth:`S3.Client.download_file`::

    import boto3

    # Get the service client
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')

    # Upload tmp.txt to bucket-name
    s3.upload_file("tmp.txt", "bucket-name", "tmp.txt")

    # Download tmp.txt as tmp2.txt
    s3.download_file("bucket-name", "tmp.txt", "tmp2.txt")

If you happen to be using the resource model, the same function are accessed
through :py:meth:`S3.Object.upload_file` and
:py:meth:`S3.Object.download_file`::

    import boto3

    # Get the service resource
    s3 = boto3.resource('s3')

    # Get bucket-name
    bucket = s3.Bucket('bucket-name')

    # Get the object representation
    obj = bucket.Object('tmp.txt')

    # Upload tmp.txt
    obj.upload_file('tmp.txt')

    # Download tmp.txt as tmp2.txt
    obj.download_file('tmp2.txt')


Generating Presigned URLs
-------------------------

Pre-signed URLs allow you to give your users access to a specific object in your
bucket without requiring them to have AWS security credentials or permissions.
To generate a pre-signed URL, use the
:py:meth:`S3.Client.generate_presigned_url` method::

    import boto3
    import requests

    # Get the service client.
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')

    # Generate the URL to get 'key-name' from 'bucket-name'
    url = s3.generate_presigned_url(
        ClientMethod='get_object',
        Params={
            'Bucket': 'bucket-name',
            'Key': 'key-name'
        }
    )

    # Use the URL to perform the GET operation. You can use any method you like
    # to send the GET, but we will use requests here to keep things simple.
    response = requests.get(url)

If your bucket requires the use of signature version 4, you can elect to use it
to sign your URL. This does not fundamentally change how you use generator,
you only need to make sure that the client used has signature version 4
configured.::

    import boto3
    from botocore.client import Config

    # Get the service client with sigv4 configured
    s3 = boto3.client('s3', config=Config(signature_version='s3v4'))

    # Generate the URL to get 'key-name' from 'bucket-name'
    url = s3.generate_presigned_url(
        ClientMethod='get_object',
        Params={
            'Bucket': 'bucket-name',
            'Key': 'key-name'
        }
    )

Note: if your bucket is new and you require CORS, it is advised that
you use path style addressing (which is set by default in signature version 4).


Generating Presigned POSTs
--------------------------

Much like pre-signed URLs, pre-signed POSTs allow you to give write access to a
user without giving them AWS credentials. The information you need to make the
POST is returned by the :py:meth:`S3.Client.generate_presigned_post` method::

    import boto3
    import requests

    # Get the service client
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')

    # Generate the POST attributes
    post = s3.generate_presigned_post(
        Bucket='bucket-name',
        Key='key-name'
    )

    # Use the returned values to POST an object. Note that you need to use ALL
    # of the returned fields in your post. You can use any method you like to
    # send the POST, but we will use requests here to keep things simple.
    files = {"file": "file_content"}
    response = requests.post(post["url"], data=post["fields"], files=files)

When generating these POSTs, you may wish to auto fill certain fields or
constrain what your users submit. You can do this by providing those fields and
conditions when you generate the POST data.::

    import boto3

    # Get the service client
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')

    # Make sure everything posted is publicly readable
    fields = {"acl": "public-read"}

    # Ensure that the ACL isn't changed and restrict the user to a length
    # between 10 and 100.
    conditions = [
        {"acl": "public-read"},
        ["content-length-range", 10, 100]
    ]

    # Generate the POST attributes
    post = s3.generate_presigned_post(
        Bucket='bucket-name',
        Key='key-name'
    )

Note: if your bucket is new and you require CORS, it is advised that
you use path style addressing (which is set by default in signature version 4).
